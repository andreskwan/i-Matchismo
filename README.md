solved issue in CardGameViewCOntroller 
I commented the cardButton setTitle:forState

TODO
- review video related with this subject

10:43
add 2 cards game mode 

11:00 solved - self matching after hit twice the same card

11:14 I identify why score is going crazy, because flip cost is happening every cicle of the for loop in flipCardAtIndex
11:19 solved

12:13 I put the string messages of the game state in the CardMatchingGame.TwoCardGame
- because this is related with the game not with the controller 

ABSTRACTION Note
This MVC must be designed in such way that I could play the game in the console or in the phone
